          <p>
            Nothapodites foetida is a plant known for producing insecticidal
            compounds, which are substances that can kill or repel insects. The
            extraction process involves obtaining these bioactive compounds from
            the plant using solvents or other methods. The isolated compounds
            are studied for their potential to act as natural insecticides,
            offering an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic chemicals in pest
            control.

            Process of spontaneous dewatering of feed solution using salt

          <p>
            Spontaneous dewatering of a feed solution using salt bitterns as
            draw solutions is a process where water is naturally removed from
            the feed solution through osmosis. Salt bitterns, which are
            concentrated brine solutions left after salt extraction, have a high
            osmotic pressure. When these bitterns are used as a draw solution,
            they pull water out of the feed solution across a semi-permeable
            membrane. This process, known as forward osmosis, concentrates the
            feed solution and dilutes the salt bitterns, enabling efficient
            dewatering without applying external energy.

          <h3>
            Eco-friendly process for the isolation of biopolymers from
            agricultural residues
          </h3>
          <p class="inv_name">
              Siddharth, Shivkumar

          <p>
            The eco-friendly process for isolating biopolymers from agricultural
            residues begins with collecting agricultural waste, such as rice
            husks or wheat straw. The residues are then cleaned to remove
            impurities through washing and drying. To extract the biopolymers,
            environmentally safe methods are used, often involving the use of
            water or mild chemicals, instead of harsh solvents. The residues may
            undergo processes like enzymatic treatment or mechanical grinding to
            break down the material and release biopolymers like cellulose,
            hemicellulose, or lignin. After extraction, the biopolymers are
            purified and dried, making them suitable for use in various
            applications, such as biodegradable plastics or sustainable
            packaging. The entire process minimizes the use of harmful
            chemicals, making it eco-friendly and sustainable.

            Smart Soil Moisture Sensor with Integrated Water Management System
          </h3>

            This patent describes an innovative soil moisture sensor that not
            only measures soil moisture levels but also integrates with a water
            management system for efficient irrigation. The sensor uses advanced
            materials and IoT technology to provide real-time soil moisture
            data. It can communicate wirelessly with a central control system,
            which analyzes the data and automatically adjusts irrigation
            schedules. The system also considers weather forecasts and
            plant-specific water requirements to optimize water usage. This
            technology significantly reduces water waste in agriculture and
            landscaping while promoting healthier plant growth.
