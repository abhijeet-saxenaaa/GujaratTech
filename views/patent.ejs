                <h3>Insecticidal Compounds from Nothapodites Foetida and Process for the Extraction thereof</h3>
                <p>Nothapodites foetida is a plant known for producing insecticidal compounds, which are substances that
                    can kill or repel insects. The extraction process involves obtaining these bioactive compounds from
                    the plant using solvents or other methods. The isolated compounds are studied for their potential to
                    act as natural insecticides, offering an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic chemicals in pest
                    control.

                <h3>Process of spontaneous dewatering of feed solution using salt bitterns as draw solutions</h3>
                <p>Spontaneous dewatering of a feed solution using salt bitterns as draw solutions is a process where
                    water is naturally removed from the feed solution through osmosis. Salt bitterns, which are
                    concentrated brine solutions left after salt extraction, have a high osmotic pressure. When these
                    bitterns are used as a draw solution, they pull water out of the feed solution across a
                    semi-permeable membrane. This process, known as forward osmosis, concentrates the feed solution and
                    dilutes the salt bitterns, enabling efficient dewatering without applying external energy.</p>

                <h3>Eco-friendly process for the isolation of biopolymers from agricultural residues</h3>
                <p>The eco-friendly process for isolating biopolymers from agricultural residues begins with collecting
                    agricultural waste, such as rice husks or wheat straw. The residues are then cleaned to remove
                    impurities through washing and drying. To extract the biopolymers, environmentally safe methods are
                    used, often involving the use of water or mild chemicals, instead of harsh solvents. The residues
                    may undergo processes like enzymatic treatment or mechanical grinding to break down the material and
                    release biopolymers like cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin. After extraction, the biopolymers are
                    purified and dried, making them suitable for use in various applications, such as biodegradable
                    plastics or sustainable packaging. The entire process minimizes the use of harmful chemicals, making
                    it eco-friendly and sustainable.</p>
